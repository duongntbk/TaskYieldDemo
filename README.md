This repository holds the sample code for my blog post about the `Task.Yield` method in .NET.

# Usage

In Visual Studio, open the *Test Explorer* window, select the `RunToCompletionTest` test, and press the `Run` button. You should see that the test runs to completion.

In the same *Test Explorer* window, select the `HangTest` test and click `Run`. You can verify that we entered an infinite loop. Terminate this test by clicking the `Stop` button.
